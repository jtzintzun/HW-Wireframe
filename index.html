      <p>After two decades in space, NASA’s Cassini spacecraft reached the end of its remarkable journey of exploration.</p>

        <h2>The Journey</h2>
        <p>In April 2017, operators placed Cassini on an impact course that unfolded over five months of daring dives — a series of 22 orbits that each passed between the planet and its rings. Called the Grand Finale, this final phase of the mission brought
          unparalleled observations of the planet and its rings from closer than ever before.</p>

          <h2>End of the Mission</h2>
          <p>Having expended almost every bit of the rocket propellant Cassini carried to Saturn, operators deliberately plunged the spacecraft into the planet to ensure Saturn’s moons will remain pristine for future exploration — in particular, the ice-covered,
            ocean-bearing moon Enceladus, but also Titan, with its intriguing pre-biotic chemistry.</p>
